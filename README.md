# EchoBot  
A smart virtual assistant that listens, understands, and performs tasks for you.

📑 **Project Overview**  
EchoBot is an AI-based virtual assistant designed to perform multiple day-to-day tasks using voice or text commands. Whether it's playing YouTube videos, checking internet speed, sending WhatsApp messages, fetching Mars images from NASA, or answering questions using Wikipedia — EchoBot makes life easier with just a few commands.

The assistant interacts using speech recognition and text-to-speech engines, offering a hands-free experience for users. On startup, it asks for voice and command permissions and provides both voice and text input options for maximum flexibility.
